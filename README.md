### 9) Install a VPN

<br />

A VPN allows you to identify your IP and therefore remain anonymous. Add to this that most solutions also offer blocking of malicious sites, trackers and data collection by third parties.

<br />

Several VPNs exist, here we offer you the choice of Mullvad-VPN or Proton-VPN.These two players are the most reliable on the market, preference to Mullvad, who has been able to prove in many cases that his no logs policy is indeed valid.

<br />

Subscriptions vary between 5 euros to 10 euros depending on the level of services you want.

Mullvad : https://mullvad.net/fr  
Proton : https://protonvpn.com/fr

<br />

Download the sofware from the AUR : 
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mullvad-vpn-bin

(Here we will use the binary version to avoid additional compilation times)

<br />

Paste in a shell : ``` yay –S mullvad-vpn-bin ```
